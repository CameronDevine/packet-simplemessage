## Installation

Make sure the version of Wireshark you have installed was compiled with Lua
support (see [wireshark.org/Lua][]).

If you're not interested in tracking development on the main branch, download
the latest release from the [GitHub Releases][] page and extract the archive
somewhere temporarily (Windows users will likely want to download the zip
archive).

### Linux (per user)

    cd $PACKET_SIMPLEMESSAGE
    mkdir -p ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins
    cp packet-simplemessage.lua ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins

### Windows (per user)

Open `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming` (Win7) or `%USERPROFILE%\Application Data`
(WinXP) and open the `Wireshark\plugins` folder (if it doesn't exist, create
it). Now copy `packet-simplemessage.lua` to the `plugins` folder.
